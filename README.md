## A MAZE GENERATOR AND SOLVER DEVELOPED IN PYTHON BY ANISH AND ARPIT

This project generates maze using Recursive backtracking algorithm and displays the maze using opencv-python library
While solving this project uses breadth first search algorithm that finds shortest path between start point and end point
